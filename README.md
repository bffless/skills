# @bffless/skills

Agent skills for [BFFless](https://bffless.app) — a self-hosted static asset hosting platform with AI-powered pipelines.

These skills give your AI coding agent domain knowledge about BFFless features so it can help you build, deploy, and configure your projects.

Originally built as a Claude Code plugin, the skills are plain markdown and also work with the open-source [`skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) CLI — so you can install them into any agent that reads skill files from your project.

## Install

### Claude Code (plugin marketplace)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add bffless/skills

# Install the plugin
/plugin install bffless
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
claude plugin install bffless --scope user
```

### Any agent (via `npx skills`)

The same skills repo works with the open-source [`skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) CLI:

```bash
# List available skills
npx skills add bffless/skills --list

# Install all skills into your project
npx skills add bffless/skills

# Install a specific skill
npx skills add bffless/skills --skill chat
```

This clones the repo and copies the selected skill files into your project so any compatible agent can read them.

### Local Development

To use a local copy with Claude Code (e.g. when contributing):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bffless/skills.git
claude --plugin-dir ./skills
```

## Usage

Once installed, your agent automatically uses these skills when you ask about BFFless features. For example:

- "Set up a proxy rule to forward /api requests to my backend"
- "Add AI chat to my site with streaming"
- "Configure traffic splitting for a canary deployment"
- "Set up the upload-artifact GitHub Action for my repo"

In Claude Code, skills are invoked by name with the `bffless` namespace:

```
/bffless:chat
/bffless:proxy-rules
/bffless:pipelines
```

## Developer Skills vs BFFless Pipeline Skills

This package contains **developer-facing agent skills** — they teach your coding agent about the BFFless platform so it can assist you while you build.

These are different from **BFFless pipeline skills**, which are markdown files you create in your own project's `.bffless/skills/` directory. Pipeline skills are deployed with your site and loaded by the AI chat handler at runtime to give your chatbot domain-specific knowledge.

|              | Developer Skills (this package)         | Pipeline Skills (your project)          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**  | Help your agent help _you_ build on BFFless | Give _your chatbot_ domain knowledge |
| **Location** | Installed via Claude Code plugin or `npx skills` | `.bffless/skills/` in your project repo |
| **Used by**  | Your coding agent (your dev tool)       | BFFless AI chat handler (your users)    |
| **Deployed** | npm / `skills` CLI                      | `bffless/upload-artifact` GitHub Action |
